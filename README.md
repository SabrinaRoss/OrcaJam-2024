After finishing Ludum Dare 56, I wanted to have a change from the usual hectic game jam environment.
I knew I wanted to use pico-8 as I generally just think that it is a really amazing piece of software. However, I did not feel that intrested this time around in making a game... what a game jam but you do not make a game?!?!?!

Orca Jam 2024 rolled around and this was when I decided to get to work:

For this game jam, I had one goal -> getting better at mobularising my code so that it could become easiler to create more complex animations later on. This was going to be a challenge however, as anyone who has ever used pico-8 would know, it's in-built text editor is abysmal... like really abysmal. Although, this is what I wanted, using a horrendious text editor allowed to to prioritise more modular design and prevented me from writing full blown spaggetti code. As I would have been unable to see my code in the editor if I had done so.

Overall, by the end of the jam, I had completed my goal of creating a basic graphics framework for creating fun aniamitons out of multiple spheres in pico-8, and overall achived my goal of becoming alot better at modular programming.
